# E-commerce Clustering Model
This repository contains a clustering model developed to analyze and segment the customer database of an e-commerce platform. The primary goal is to identify distinct groups of customers based on their purchasing behaviors, enabling the company to make informed decisions regarding marketing, sales, and customer service.

## Purpose
The objectives of this repository are to:

### Customer Analysis:
Apply clustering techniques to segment customers with similar characteristics and behaviors.
### Personalized Strategies:
Utilize the identified clusters to develop targeted and personalized marketing strategies, improving customer retention and satisfaction.
### Resource Optimization:
Help the company optimize its resources and efforts based on the characteristics of the identified customer groups.
## Methodology
The clustering model was developed using the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, which includes the following steps:

### Business Understanding:
Define business objectives and understand the companyâ€™s needs regarding customer analysis.

### Data Understanding:
Analyze the e-commerce database, including variables such as purchase history, purchase frequency, and total spending.

### Data Preparation:
Clean and preprocess the data, including normalization and handling missing values, ensuring that the dataset is ready for modeling.

### Modeling:
Implement the clustering model using algorithms such as KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture. The choice of the number of clusters was determined based on metrics such as the silhouette score and the elbow method.

### Evaluation:
Assess the performance of the clustering model by analyzing the quality of the formed clusters and how they align with business objectives.

### Implementation:
Apply the insights gained to develop marketing strategies and enhance customer experiences.

## Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for implementing the model.
Scikit-learn: Used to apply clustering algorithms and evaluations.
Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizing and analyzing results.
## Results
The clustering results provide a detailed view of the different customer segments within the e-commerce database. With this information, the company can tailor its marketing campaigns and enhance its offerings, resulting in greater customer satisfaction and retention.

## Future Improvements
As I continue to explore clustering techniques and machine learning, I plan to add more methods and comparisons between different clustering algorithms, as well as apply the models to new datasets.
